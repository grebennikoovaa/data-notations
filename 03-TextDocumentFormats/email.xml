        Dear John Doe, 

        I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request permission to receive a social scholarship. 
        Could you kindly guide me through the necessary steps and documentation required for the application process? 
        I appreciate your support and assistance.

        Best regards,
        Jane Smith
